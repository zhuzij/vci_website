## learn how to collaborate with others in Github
first off, I learned that I couldn't create a branch protection rule without first upgrading my github account to Github Team or Enterprise organization account.
now I have to convert my vci_website repo public to be able to lab this part - this is how: I signed in to my zhuzij github account and went to Settings/Danger Zone, clicked Change visibility.
I then added main branch protection rule to require pull request for merge into the main branch.

## The branch protection rule got bypassed:
PS D:\git_projects\learn_git> git commit -m "documented making zhuzij/vci_website public for practicing collaboration"
[main 01100d0] documented making zhuzij/vci_website public for practicing collaboration

I since added zhuzij2 as a collaborator and it remains bypassing my git push to main???!
I'd need to properly sync my secondary account local repo with remote repo.
